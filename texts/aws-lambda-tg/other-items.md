# Cost consideration
What is free and paid, up to what limit

## Compute pricing (Lambda)

## Storage pricing (EFS)
Accrording to [EFS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/) there is a free tier:
> As part of the AWS Free Tier, you can get started with Amazon EFS for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5 GB of Amazon EFS storage in the EFS Standard storage class for **12 months**. The AWS Free Tier is not applicable to files stored in the EFS One Zone storage class.

Sounds good. I hope I'll get the citizenship before those 12 months! Although realistically speaking, I will continue using AWS storage for other projects, so pay day will come. It will only be $0.09 per GB per month, though. 

Amazon Standard class looks good and it's covered by the Free Tier.
