Hi

Working on my citizenship tracker thing. 

There's a question what is the most optimal way to learn new stuff: 1) do some hands-on projects and learn what is directly needed for those projects and 2) go through the whole functionality using documentation, a tutorial or a textbook. The first one is best for motivation and skill retention. The caveat is, the projects will certainly not cover the whole domain, and lots of usefull stuff will be overlooked. As usual, some balance is probably needed. Look around a little when you research your narrow practical task. Think of how to apply capabilities when you learn theory through a structured framework.
