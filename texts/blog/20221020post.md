Assuming

```
let creds = JSON.parse(contentFile);
//console.log(creds.credentials[0])
let credentials = creds.credentials;
```

Why these are not identical?

```
console.log(credentials[0])
console.log(credentials[1])
```

and

```
for (let cred in credentials){
    console.log(cred);
    }
```

Oh, got it. This works:

```
for (let cred in credentials){
        console.log(credentials[cred]);
    }
```

cred is not the object of the array itself. It's an iterator of this array. I still need to write credentials[cred] to access the object corresponding to the index.
